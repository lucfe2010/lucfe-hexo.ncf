The<br>number is the concept represented by the numeral, and therefore consists of a whole network<br>of connections between symbols, pictures, language and real-life situations.</p>
<p>The same number (for example, the one we call ‘three hundred and sixty-six’) can be represented by different numerals – such as 366 in our Hindu-Arabic, place-value system, and CCCLXVI using<br>Roman numerals</p>
<p>Because the Hindu-Arabic system of numeration is now more or less universal, the distinction between the numeral and the number is easily lost.</p>
<h3 id="What-are-the-cardinal-and-ordinal-aspects-of-number"><a href="#What-are-the-cardinal-and-ordinal-aspects-of-number" class="headerlink" title="What are the cardinal and ordinal aspects of number?"></a>What are the cardinal and ordinal aspects of number?</h3><blockquote>
<p>cardinal基数；<br>a number, such as 1, 2 and 3, used to show quantity rather than order</p>
<p>ordinal序数词（如第一、第二等）<br>a number that refers to the position of sth in a series, for example ‘first’, ‘second’, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>s an adjective describing a small set<br>of objects: two brothers, three sweets, five fingers, three blocks, and so on. This idea of a number<br>being a description of a set of things is called the <code>cardinal aspect of number</code>.</p>
<p>numbers used<br>as labels to put things in order. For example, they<br>turn to page 3 in a book.<br>The numerals and words being used here do not represent<br>cardinal numbers, because they are not referring to sets of three things.In these examples, ‘three’ is one thing, which is labelled three because of the<br>position in which it lies in some ordering process. This is called the <code>ordinal aspect of number</code>.</p>
<p>The most important experience of the ordinal aspect of number is when<br>we represent numbers as locations on a number strip  or as points on<br>a number line</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/math_primary/image.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>There is a further way in which numerals are used,<br>sometimes called the <code>nominal aspect</code>. This is where<br>the numeral is used as a label or a name, without any<br>ordering implied. The usual example to give here<br>would be a number 7 bus.</p>

<p>The term ‘rational’ derives from the idea that a fraction represents a ratio.</p>
<p>The technical<br>definition of a rational number is any number that is the ratio of two integers.</p>
<p>Rational numbers enable us to subdivide the<br>sections of the number line between the integers and to label the points in between,</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/math_primary/image-2.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<hr>
<p>there are other real numbers that cannot be written down as exact fractions or decimals – and are therefore not rational.</p>
<p>there is no fraction or decimal that is exactly equal to the square root of 50 (written as √50).<br>This means there is no rational number that when multiplied by itself gives exactly the answer<br>50.</p>
<p>– we could never get a number<br>that gave us 50 exactly when we squared it.</p>
<p>But √50 is a real number – in the sense that it<br>represents a real point on a continuous number line, somewhere between 7 and 8. It represents<br>a real length. So this is a real length, a real number, but<br>it is not a rational number. It is called <code>an irrational number</code>.<br>利用勾股定理得到平方根数的实际长度</p>
<p>the<br>set of real numbers includes all rational numbers – which include integers, which in turn<br>include natural numbers – and all irrational numbers.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-meant-by-‘place-value’"><a href="#What-is-meant-by-‘place-value’" class="headerlink" title="What is meant by ‘place value’?"></a>What is meant by ‘place value’?</h3><p>in the Hindu-Arabic system<br>we do not use a symbol representing a hundred to<br>construct three hundreds: we use a symbol representing three! Just this one symbol is needed to represent<br>three hundreds, and we know that it represents three<br>hundreds, rather than three tens or three ones, because<br>of the <code>place</code> in which it is written.</p>
<p>in our Hindu-Arabic place-value system, all<br>numbers can be represented using a finite set of digits,<br>namely, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
<p>Like most numeration systems, no doubt because of the availability of<br>our ten fingers for counting purposes, the system uses<br>ten as a base.</p>
<p>Larger whole numbers than 9 are constructed using powers of the base: ten, a hundred, a<br>thousand, and so on.</p>
<p>The place in which a digit is written, then, represents that number of one of these powers<br>of ten</p>
<p>for example, working from right to left, in the numeral 2345 the 5 represents<br>5 ones (or units), the 4 represents 4 tens, the 3 represents 3 hundreds and the 2 represents<br>2 thousands.</p>
<p>the<br>numeral 2345 is essentially a clever piece of shorthand, condensing a complicated mathematical<br>expression into four symbols, as follows:<br>(2 × 103) + (3 × 102) + (4 × 101) + 5 &#x3D; 2345.</p>
<p>Perversely, we work from right to left in determining the place values, with<br>increasing powers of ten as we move in this direction. But, since we read from left to right,<br>the numeral is read with the largest place value first</p>
<hr>
<p>the principle of <code>exchange</code>.<br>This means that whenever you have accumulated ten in one place, this can be exchanged for<br>one in the next place to the left. This principle of being able to ‘exchange one of these for ten<br>of those’ as you move left to right along the powers of ten, or to ‘exchange ten of these for one<br>of those’ as you move right to left, is a very significant feature of the place-value system.</p>
<p>This principle of exchanging is also fundamental to the ways we do calculations with<br>numbers. It is the principle of ‘carrying one’ in addition</p>
<p>It also means that,<br>when necessary, we can exchange one in any place for ten in the next place on the right, for<br>example when doing subtraction by decomposition.</p>

Translated into symbols,<br>without the use of a zero, this would easily be confused with thirty-seven: 37. The zero is used therefore as a <strong>place holder</strong>; that is, to indicate the position<br>of the tens’ place, even though there are no tens<br>there: 307. It is worth noting, therefore, that when we<br>see a numeral such as 300, we should not think to<br>ourselves that the 00 means ‘hundred’.It is the position of the 3 that indicates that it stands for ‘three hundred’; the function of the zeros is to make this<br>position clear whilst indicating that there are no tens<br>and no ones.</p>

<p>There are two basic categories of real-life problems that are modelled by the mathematical<br>operation we call addition.</p>
<p>• the aggregation structure;<br>• the augmentation structure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>aggregation聚合;<br>the act of gathering something together</p>
<p>augmentation增加；<br>the amount by which something increases</p>

<p>t the two sets do not overlap.<br>They are called <strong>discrete sets</strong>. When two sets are combined into one set, they form what is called the <strong>union of sets</strong>.So another way of describing this addition structure<br>is ‘the union of two discrete sets’.</p>
<p>This notion of addition<br>builds mainly on the <strong>cardinal aspect</strong> of number, the idea<br>of number as a set of things</p>

<p>temperature<br>an increase in temperature from a given starting temperature.</p>
<p>their age:</p>
<p>in other measurement contexts,</p>
<p>The key language that signals the operation of<br>addition is that of ‘increasing’ or ‘counting on’.</p>

The fact that these two additions come to the same result is an example of what<br>is called the <code>commutative law of addition</code>.</p>
<p>We can state this commutative law formally by the following generalization, which is true whatever the<br>numbers a and b: a + b &#x3D; b + a.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>commutative交换的（排列次序不影响结果）<br>giving the same result whatever the order in which the quantities are shown</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Second, it<br>is important to make use of commutativity in<br>addition calculations. Particularly when using the<br>idea of counting on, it is nearly always better to<br>start with the bigger number.</p>
<p>For example, it<br>would not be sensible to calculate 3 + 59 by starting at 3 and counting on 59! The obvious thing to do is to use the commutative law<br>mentally to change the addition to 59 + 3, then start at 59 and count on 3.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>articulate清楚说明<br>to express or explain your thoughts or feelings clearly in words</p>

<p>The phrase ‘<strong>inverse of addition</strong>’<br>underlines the idea that subtraction and addition are <strong>inverse processes</strong>.The concept of <strong>inverse</strong> turns up in many situations in mathematics,<br>whenever one operation or transformation undoes<br>the effect of another one.</p>
<p>Hence, to solve a<br>problem of the form ‘what must be added to x to give<br>y?’ we subtract x from y</p>

Written formally, as a generalization, it is the assertion that for any numbers a, b and c:<br>a + (b + c) &#x3D; (a + b) + c.</p>
<p>The brackets<br>indicate which addition should be done first. In simple terms, the associative law says that if<br>you have three numbers to add together you get the same answer, whether you start by adding<br>the second and third or start by adding the first and second.</p>

We have to break the 5 down<br>into two bits, 3 and 2. The 3 gets us to the next multiple of 10 (60) and then we have 2 more<br>to count on. This process of using a multiple of ten (60) as a <strong>stepping stone</strong> is an important<br>mental strategy for addition and subtraction. Some writers refer to this process as ‘<strong>bridging</strong>’.</p>
<p>Here is how we might use this idea of a stepping<br>stone for calculating, say, 57 + 28. First, we could<br>count on in 10s, to deal with adding the 20: 57 … 67,<br>77. Then break the 8 up into 3 and 5, to enable us to<br>use 80 as a stepping stone: 77 + 8 &#x3D; 77 + 3 + 5 &#x3D;<br>80 + 5 &#x3D; 85.</p>
<p>A number-line diagram is a very useful image for<br>supporting this kind of reasoning. Children can be<br>taught to use an empty number line, which is simply a line on which they can put whatever numbers<br>they like, not worrying about the scale, just ensuring<br>that numbers are in the right order relative to each other.</p>

<h3 id="What-is-front-end-addition-and-subtraction"><a href="#What-is-front-end-addition-and-subtraction" class="headerlink" title="What is front-end addition and subtraction?"></a>What is front-end addition and subtraction?</h3><p>Most formal written algorithms for addition and subtraction work with the digits from right<br>to left, starting with the units. In mental calculations, it is much more common to work from<br>left to right. This makes more sense, because you deal with the biggest and most significant<br>bits of the numbers first.</p>
<p>One strategy is to mentally break the numbers up into hundreds, tens<br>and ones, and then to combine them bit by bit, starting at the front end – that is, starting by<br>adding (or subtracting) the hundreds.This process is sometimes called<br>partitioning into hundreds, tens and ones.</p>
<p>So, for example, given 459 + 347, we would think of<br>the 459 as (400 + 50 + 9) and the 347 as (300 + 40 + 7).</p>
<p>The <code>front-end approach</code> would deal with<br>the hundreds first (400 + 300 &#x3D; 700), then the tens<br>(50 + 40 &#x3D; 90, making 790 so far) and then the ones<br>(for example, 790 + 9 &#x3D; 799; followed by 799 + 7 &#x3D;<br>799 + 1 + 6 &#x3D; 806). Notice that I have used 800 as a<br><code>stepping stone</code> for the last step here.</p>
<p>459 + 347 &#x3D; (400 + 50 + 9) + (300 + 40 + 7)<br>&#x3D; (400 + 300) + (50 + 40) + (9 + 7)<br>&#x3D; 700 + 90 + 9 + 7<br>&#x3D; 799 + 7 &#x3D; 799 + 1 + 6 &#x3D; 800 + 6 &#x3D; 806.</p>

<p>For example, many people would<br>evaluate 673 + 99 by adding 1 temporarily to the 99, so the question becomes 673 + 100.<br>This gives 773. Now take off the extra 1, to get the answer 772. This strategy is sometimes<br>called compensation.</p>
<p>The trick in the strategy is always to be on the lookout for an easier calculation than the<br>one you have to do. This will often involve temporarily replacing a number ending in a 9 or<br>an 8 with the next multiple of 10.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/math_primary/image-15.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>There are other ways of using the strategy of compensation, all of which amount to changing one or<br>more of the numbers in order to produce an easier<br>calculation.</p>

<p>48 + 46 could be related to double 46: 46 + 46 &#x3D; 92, so 48 + 46 &#x3D; 92 + 2 &#x3D; 94.<br>62 + 59 could be related to double 60: 60 + 60 &#x3D; 120, so 62 + 59 &#x3D; 120 + 2 – 1 &#x3D; 121.<br>54 – 28 could be related to half 54 (27): 54 – 27 &#x3D; 27, so 54 – 28 &#x3D; 27 – 1 &#x3D; 26.<br>54 – 28 could be related to half 56 (28): 56 – 28 &#x3D; 28, so 54 – 28 &#x3D; 28 – 2 &#x3D; 26.</p>

<p>In everyday life, we often require no more than<br>an approximate indication of what the result should be for many of the calculations we<br>engage with – particularly since, in practice, difficult calculations will usually be done on a<br>piece of technology where the likeliest error is that we enter the numbers incorrectly.</p>

<p>Second, there are those problems that incorporate the idea of repeated addition to reach<br>a target, such as ‘how many sets of 4 do you need to get a set of 20?</p>

<p>For<br>example, if A earns £300 a week and B earns £900 a week,we could also compare A’s and B’s<br>earnings by looking at their ratio, stating, for example, that B earns <em><strong>three times more</strong></em> than A.</p>

<p>Remainders do not occur where division is used to model situations with the ratio structure.</p>

<p>It is the commutative law that allows me to switch the<br>order of two numbers in a multiplication freely like this: 5 × 28 &#x3D; 28 × 5.</p>
<p>think of the 28 as 14 × 2, choose to do 2 × 5 first (to get 10)<br>and then multiply this by 14<br> I am ‘associating’ the 2 with the 5, rather than with the 14, in order to<br>make the calculation easier: (14 × 2) × 5 &#x3D; 14 × (2 × 5).</p>
<p>An alternative approach to calculating 28 × 5 would be to split the 28 into 20 + 8 and then<br>to multiply the 20 and 8 separately by the 5<br>(20 + 8) × 5 &#x3D; (20 × 5) + (8 × 5)</p>
<p>Finally, we could choose to think of the 28 as 30 – 2 and then ‘distribute’ the multiplication<br>by 5 across this subtraction:<br>using the second of the distributive laws of multiplication:<br>(30 – 2) × 5 &#x3D; (30 × 5) – (2 × 5)</p>

<p>The second prerequisite is that you should be able<br>to derive from any one of these results a whole series<br>of results for multiplications involving multiples of<br>10 and 100.</p>

<p>700 × 80, we can think<br>of the 700 as 7 × 100 and the 80 as 8 × 10. Then the<br>whole calculation becomes: 7 × 100 × 8 × 10. Using<br>the freedom granted to us by the commutative and<br>associative laws of multiplication to rearrange this<br>how we like, we can think of it as (7 × 8) ×<br>(100 × 10), which leads to 56 × 1000 &#x3D; 56,000.</p>
<p>The third prerequisite is that you should be able to<br>recognize all the division results that are simply the<br>inverses of any of the above results. For example:<br>56 ÷ 8 &#x3D; 7<br>56 ÷ 7 &#x3D; 8<br>560 ÷ 8 &#x3D; 70<br>5600 ÷ 70 &#x3D; 80<br>56,000 ÷ 800 &#x3D; 70</p>

<p>First, by breaking up the 26 into 10 + 10 + 2 +<br>2 + 2, on the basis that I am confident in multiplying by<br>10 and by 2, we can transform 26 × 34 into (10 × 34) +<br>(10 × 34) + (2 × 34) + (2 × 34) + (2 × 34)</p>
<p>A second ad hoc approach to this calculation would be to think of the 34 as 10 + 10 +<br>10 + 5 – 1, so that 26 × 34 becomes (26 × 10) + (26 × 10) + (26 × 10) + (26 × 5) – (26 × 1),</p>

Formally, the child is breaking the 608 up into<br>320 + 160 + 64 + 64 and distributing the division by 32 across this addition as follows:<br>608 ÷ 32 &#x3D; (320 + 160 + 64 + 64) ÷ 32<br> &#x3D; (320 ÷ 32) + (160 ÷ 32) + (64 ÷ 32) + (64 ÷ 32)<br> &#x3D; 10 + 5 + 2 + 2 &#x3D; 19</p>

<p>The division 75 ÷ 5 can be used to demonstrate the application of this principle. Multiply<br>both numbers by 2 and the question becomes 150 ÷ 10. So the answer is clearly 15.</p>
<p>We can also use the reverse principle: that we do not change the answer to a division calculation if we divide both numbers by the same thing.<br>648 ÷ 24 is the same as 324 ÷ 12 (dividing both numbers by 2)<br>324 ÷ 12 is the same as 108 ÷ 4 (dividing both numbers by 3)<br>108 ÷ 4 is the same as 54 ÷ 2 (dividing both numbers by 2), which is 27</p>

The answer to this question is 2, which is written above the 4 in<br>648. You then write the product of 2 and 24 (48) under the 64 and subtract, giving 16. The<br>8 in the 648 is then brought down and written next to the 16, making 168 in this row. You<br>then ask, how many 24s are there in 168? The answer to this is 7, which is written above<br>the 8 in 648. You then write the product of 7 and 24 (168) under the 168 and subtract it,<br>giving zero.

<p>making use of the digital sum for each number. This is the number you get<br>if you add up the digits in the given number. If you then add up the digits in the digital sum,<br>and keep going with this process of adding the digits until a single-digit answer is obtained,<br>the number you get is called the digital root.</p>
<p>some useful tricks for spotting various multiples:<br>• Every natural number is a multiple of 1.<br>• All even numbers (numbers ending in 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8) are multiples of 2.<br>• A number that has a digital sum that is a multiple of 3 is itself a multiple of 3.<br>• The digital root of a multiple of 3 is always 3, 6 or 9.<br>• If the last two digits of a number give a multiple of 4, then it is a multiple of 4.<br>• Any number ending in 0 or 5 is a multiple of 5.<br>• Multiples of 6 are multiples of both 3 and 2. So, any even number with a digital root of 3,<br>6 or 9 must be a multiple of 6.<br>• If the last three digits of a number give a multiple of 8, then the number is a multiple<br>of 8.<br>• A number that has a digital sum that is a multiple of 9 is itself a multiple of 9.<br>• The digital root of a multiple of 9 is always 9.<br>• Any number ending in 0 is a multiple of 10.</p>

<p>if I can only buy a certain kind of biscuit in packets of 10 and I want to share all<br>the biscuits equally between 6 people, the number of biscuits I buy must be a multiple of<br>both 6 and 10; so the smallest number I can purchase is the lowest common multiple, which<br>is 30 biscuits.</p>

<p>The mathematical relationship, ‘is a factor of’, also possesses the transitive property, as<br>illustrated in Figure 13.4. So, for example, any factor of 12 must be a factor of 24, because<br>12 is a factor of 24.</p>

So numbers, such as 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, and so on, which can be represented by<br>square arrays, as shown in Figure 13.6, are called square numbers.</p>
<p>If we use an array of small<br>squares, called <strong>square units</strong>, as in Figure 13.6(b), rather than just dots, as in Figure 13.6(a),<br>then the number of squares in the array also corresponds to the total area</p>
<p>Square numbers are also composite<br>(rectangular) numbers, just as squares are rectangles</p>
<p>Most positive integers have an even number of factors.<br>This is because factors tend to come in pairs.<br>square numbers always have an odd number of factors!</p>
<h3 id="What-are-cube-numbers"><a href="#What-are-cube-numbers" class="headerlink" title="What are cube numbers?"></a>What are cube numbers?</h3><p>there are those, such as 1, 8 and<br>27, that can be represented by arrangements in the shape of a cube. These cube numbers<br>will turn up in exploring the volumes of cubes with older children. Figure 13.8 shows how<br>the first three cube numbers are constructed from small cubes, called cubic units.</p>

Or,<br>which number has a square equal to 729? The answer (27) is called the square root of 729.</p>
<p>what is the<br>length of the side of a cube with a total volume of<br>729 cubic units? Or, in arithmetic terms, what<br>number has a cube equal to 729? The answer (9) is called the cube root of 729. A</p>

<p>the so-called triangle numbers. These are the numbers that correspond to the particular pattern of triangles of dots shown in Figure 13.10: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, and so<br>on.</p>
